# myPortfolio - aquakiraproject
🌐 Portfolio Website Description (Laravel-Based)
Welcome to my personal portfolio — a growing space where I document my journey as a software engineering student. Built with Laravel, this website is both a learning project and a showcase of the skills I'm developing along the way.

🎯 Purpose:
This portfolio is a reflection of my growth as a developer. It’s a space where I experiment, build, and share what I’m learning — from basic web development to more advanced backend concepts. As I continue my studies, this site will evolve with me.
